# Errors in python:
# 1) Syntax errors
# When i try to print "Hello" without parenthesis encapsuling it, it gives an error
'''print "Hello"

# 2) Name errors
# when the spelling of the words are not the same as the one defined or the word itself is'nt defined
prints("Hello word")

# 3) Indentation errors
# This is when the codes are not indented properly
print("Hey")
    print("Hello boy")'''

# Value errors 
# As you can see this pops of when i try to cast strings to integer which just cannot work...

'''user_input = str(input("Enter your name : "))
print(int(user_input))'''

# I feel there are more error types like TypeError (if i still remember) and i'm going to explore more of them in the near future...
